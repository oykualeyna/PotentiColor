# PotColor
STM32 Nucleo-144 development board with STM32F767ZI MCU + Common Cathode RGB LED
Board: STM32 Nucleo-144 development board with STM32F767ZI MCU

RGB Type: Common Cathode RGB LED

Software IDE: STM32CubeIDE.

Programming Language: C.

Application Purpose: The purpose of this application is to control the color of an RGB LED using a potentiometer. While turning the potentiometer, the user can adjust the LED’s color . This project is a simple example of how user-controlled lighting systems, such as mood lighting, can work in real life.

The potentiometer sends a signal to the controller, which changes the LED’s color based on how far the potentiometer is turned. This way, users can easily pick different colors without needing complicated controls.

It’s a practical project that shows how interactive lighting can be used in smart homes, DIY projects, or even for prototyping new ideas.
